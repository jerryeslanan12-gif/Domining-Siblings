# 🚀 QUICK START - Make Your PC a Global Server

## ⚡ Fastest Way to Get Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open PowerShell in Project Folder
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Administrator\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\domining-sibling
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Method

#### 🌟 **RECOMMENDED: Global Access (Ngrok)**
```powershell
npm run global
```
- ✅ Works from anywhere in the world
- ✅ Auto-installs ngrok
- ✅ Secure HTTPS connection
- ✅ Most reliable

#### 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE: SSH Tunnel (Serveo)**
```powershell
npm run server
```
- ✅ No installation needed
- ✅ Free forever
- ⚠️ May be less stable

#### 🏠 **LOCAL ONLY: Same WiFi**
```powershell
npm run dev
```
(In another terminal: `node server.js`)
- ✅ Fast and simple
- ⚠️ Only works on same network

### Step 3: Share the URL!

The script will display a **public URL** like:
```
https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

**Copy and share this URL** with your family members!

---

## 📱 What Family Members Do

1. **Open the URL** you shared (in any browser)
2. **Login** with their account
3. **Use the app!** (Feed, Messages, Student Hub, etc.)

---

## ⚠️ Important

- **Keep the PowerShell window open** (closing = server stops)
- **Keep your PC on** and connected to internet
- **URL may change** when you restart (free plans)
